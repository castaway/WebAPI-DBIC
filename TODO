implement nested inserts
implement returning new resource after insert/update, via ?prefetch=self ?
error reporting (in HAL format)
validation / db constraints

look for business logic in stripes

add partial response support (eg esp for sets with prefetch which get big)
use curie prefix in link keys

limit fields returned by default - add to the code on demand, so we know the
fields are actually being used and the inverse, that we can remove/change a
field that's not being exposed and know that no users of the api will be affected.
